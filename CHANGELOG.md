# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file, in reverse chronological order by release.

## 1.1.0 - 2020-08-06

### Added

- [#18](https://github.com/laminas/automatic-releases/pull/18) adds support for using `CHANGELOG.md` files in [Keep-A-Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com) format for the release notes. When such a file is found, the tooling will set the release date in the file, commit and push it, and then extract that changelog version to use in the release notes. It still pulls release notes from patches associated with the milestone as well, in order to provide attribution and provide additional insight into the changes associated with the release.
